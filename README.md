## 📋 Task Brief

> TASK 4: NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
>
> - Set up a network-based intrusion detection system using tools like Snort or Suricata  
> - Configure rules and alerts to detect suspicious or malicious activity  
> - Monitor network traffic continuously for potential threats  
> - Implement response mechanisms for detected intrusions  
> - Optionally, visualize detected attacks using dashboards or graphs

## 📝 Task Description

Set up and configure a Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata on pfSense. The goal was to monitor network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity, trigger alerts, and optionally visualize attack patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- pfSense Firewall/Router
- Suricata IDS (installed on pfSense)
- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Server & Ubuntu Desktop
- Kali Linux (Attacker VM)
- LAN & WAN Virtual Network Configuration
- IP Address Management
- Firewall Rules (pfSense)

---

## 🧱 Network Architecture

The network was segmented into:
- LAN Network (Internal): Includes Ubuntu Server & Desktop
- Attacker Network: Kali Linux on a separate internal adapter
- Router (pfSense): Controls and monitors traffic using Suricata IDS

Refer to the /screenshots/1_network_topology.png image for a visual overview.

---

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

1. Virtual Environment Setup using VirtualBox
2. pfSense Configuration with 3 adapters:
   - WAN
   - LAN
   - Attacker Net
3. Suricata Installation on pfSense via packages
4. Interface Binding & Configuration for IDS
5. Creating and Applying Suricata Rules
6. Simulating Attacks from Kali Linux (e.g., Nmap scans)
7. Monitoring Alerts generated by Suricata
8. Firewall Rules Enforcement using UFW & pfSense to block attacker access

## 🚨 Reflections & Lessons Learned

- Learned how to deploy Suricata IDS on a network edge device (pfSense).
- Understood how to configure multiple VirtualBox adapters and isolate network zones.
- Simulated real-world attacks and observed IDS logging & alerting behavior.
- Reinforced the importance of firewall layering and intrusion detection in network security.
